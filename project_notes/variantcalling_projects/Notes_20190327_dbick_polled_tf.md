# Polled TF investigation
---
*3/27/2019*

These are my notes on trying to identify transcription factor binding sites in the regions of the polled gene for future gene editing experiments.

## Recap of conversation

We want to try to identify any functional element within the polled locus that may be causal for the phenotype. One possibility is to identify TF factors in the region. I will try to do a liftover from my previous analysis. Worst case -- I may need to rerun TFLOC or find human sequence conservation sites to do this.
