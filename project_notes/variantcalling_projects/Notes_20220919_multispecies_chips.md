## Background information

First, I am going to conduct my analysis on pig (c value = 2.8 gbp) because this is the easiest test case. The strategy is to select the markers that are most evenly distributed across the genome, and to select a number of markers that corresponds to the 200 kb distribution value. This is currently 14,000, but by adding 25% on top (as a buffer, we get to 17,500 markers.
